title: Case Studies of Cities
uid: b8009992-c0eb-deb7-77cd-12da197338e8
---

You may present a case study of cities in which it is possible to demonstrate specific relationships between form and society, either today or historically. Often these relationships are clearer under conditions of dramatic change, as in the change from colonial to post-colonial cities, or in the reaction of urban society to sudden stress. Here the problem is often one of finding the data, but achievable if you can do the digging.
