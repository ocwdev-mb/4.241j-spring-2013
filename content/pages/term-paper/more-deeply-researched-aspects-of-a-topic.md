uid: 10d5014a-51a8-5c2e-e061-9feaedc72710
---

You may pursue more deeply researched aspects of a topic that has been discussed in the class lectures. Here the task is to examine an aspect of a topic critically, to solidify vague but provocative notions, or to use the paper to strengthen your own interest in a special area. You either have to find more detailed information, or be able to arrange arguments in a different way.
