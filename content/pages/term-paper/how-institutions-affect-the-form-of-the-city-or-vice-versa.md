These are generally topics that require a careful examination of an institution and a way of modeling it, a way of conceptualizing the physical environment, and finally, a good explanation of how these fit together. Or the order can be reversed. These are not easy tasks. Some hold strong opinions about these kinds of subjects; for example, how tall office towers represent exploitation of land and human resources, but seldom demonstrate these relationships convincingly.
